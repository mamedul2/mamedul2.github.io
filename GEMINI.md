# Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Mamedul Islam, a freelance web developer. The site showcases his skills, services, and portfolio. It's a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using Bootstrap for the responsive layout and jQuery for dynamic elements.

## Key Technologies

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap 4.5
*   **Backend (for contact form):** PHP
*   **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Inter)
*   **Icons:** Font Awesome

## Project Structure

The main content is in `index.html`. The styling is in `assets/css/style.css`, and the JavaScript is in `assets/js/script.js`. The `assets/images` directory contains images for the portfolio and testimonials.

## Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the project, you can open the `index.html` file in a web browser. For the contact form to work, you will need a PHP-enabled web server.

### Development Conventions

The code is well-structured and follows standard web development practices. The CSS is organized with comments for each section, and the JavaScript is also well-commented. The project uses a dark mode feature, which can be toggled with a button.
